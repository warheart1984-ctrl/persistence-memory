# Jarvis Continuity Ledger

**Continuity infrastructure** for Mandala Rendering Software agents — isolated under
`jarvis-memoryboard/`. The service is **stateless/replaceable**; continuity lives in
governed ledger records — not in chat transcripts.

The Continuity Ledger **preserves what was recorded** with provenance. It does **not**
determine epistemic truth (see `docs/CONTINUITY_LEDGER_SOC.md`). The broader
**Constitutional Continuity Service (CCS)** vision is largely **declared**
(`docs/CCS_CHARTER.md`).

## Maturity (evidence-bound)

### Continuity Ledger (this package)

## Canonical record fields (`continuity-ledger-v1`)

Every memory includes:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `id` | yes | `mem-…` |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | yes | ISO-8601 UTC timestamps |
| `source_agent` | yes | Who wrote it |
| `session_id` | yes | Which session produced it |
| `type` | yes | `decision \| fact \| task \| preference \| architecture \| research` |
| `confidence` | yes | Caller-asserted `0.0–1.0` (not inferred by ledger) |
| `evidence` | yes | list of `{kind, ref, note?}` (may be empty) |
| `supersedes` | optional | Recorded replacement **claim** — never silent merge |
| `status` | yes | Claimed lifecycle: `draft \| verified \| archived` |
| `content` | yes | Decision/fact text (not a chat dump) |
| `subject` | optional | Conflict grouping key |
| `content_sha256` | yes | Normalized-content hash for drift checks |

Legacy rows migrate on load to ledger fields and re-save with `"schema": "continuity-ledger-v1"`.

## EMR MCP Tools: Constitutional Memory for AI

This package exposes a governed memory interface for MCP-compatible agents (ChatGPT, Cursor, OpenCode, etc.).
EMR sits between the agent and the Continuity Ledger, enforcing provenance, abstention, conflict membranes, and STM/LTM separation.

### Available Tools

- `emr_remember` — create a governed durable memory (**draft**; requires `JARVIS_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=true` + `user_requested=true`)
- `emr_upsert` — update or supersede an existing memory (lineage preserved; same gates)
- `emr_recall` — retrieve a governed recall bundle for the current intent

### Architecture

```
Agent (ChatGPT) → EMR (write) → Continuity Ledger (LTM)
Continuity Ledger → EMR (read) → STM → Agent (ChatGPT)
```

The agent never touches the ledger directly; all reads/writes flow through EMR.

### EMR → STM → LTM pipeline (`POST /api/jarvis/memory/pipeline`)

A single governed entry point that runs the full memory hierarchy end-to-end:

```
LTM (Continuity Ledger) --excite--> STM (active working set)
STM  ------consolidate----->  LTM (governed DRAFT write back)
```

1. **EMR → STM**: `excite()` scores LTM candidates, promotes the active working
   set into the session's STM view (budgeted, decay-aware, abstention-safe).
2. **STM → LTM**: newly-promoted entries are consolidated back to the ledger as
   ONE governed **draft** summary record via the `emr_write` gateway — never
   verified, never bypassing the conflict membrane / transcript gate, and with
   full `stm-provenance` evidence back to the source `memory_id`s.

The pipeline **never auto-verifies** (`manifest.verified == 0`); verification
stays operator/off-band. If a caller-supplied subject already has active claims,
the consolidated draft falls back to an un-subjected summary to preserve the
conflict membrane. Returns a replayable `PipelineTrace` (STM view + promoted ids
+ consolidation outcome + manifest).

Example:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/jarvis/memory/pipeline \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"axiom gpu delegation","session_id":"chat-c","source_agent":"chatgpt","user_requested":true}'
```

Requires `JARVIS_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=true` and, at the endpoint, the memory-write
gate. See `app/emr_pipeline.py` and `tests/test_emr_pipeline.py`.

See:

- `docs/CONSTITUTIONAL_MEMORY_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/EMR_RECALL_PROTOCOL.md`
- `docs/EMR_WHITEPAPER.md`
- `docs/MCP_EMR_SETUP.md`

### Developer onboarding (short)

1. Understand layers: EMR (governed activation) · Continuity Ledger (LTM SoT) · STM (view-only) · Agent (proposes via MCP).
2. Run tests: `cd jarvis-memoryboard && pytest tests/test_emr*.py -q`
3. Start service: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001`
4. Confirm catalog: `GET /api/jarvis/tools` lists all three tools.
5. For writes locally: `export JARVIS_MCP_WRITE_ENABLED=true` and always pass `user_requested=true`.
6. Keep public Render recall-only until you intentionally enable MCP writes on a private host.

## Prove Continuity across chats

1. Chat A: POST `type=decision` with `session_id=chat-a` and stable `subject`.
2. Chat B: `GET /api/jarvis/memory/retrieve?query=…&truth_scope=live` — same `id` + `content_sha256`.
3. Chat C: `GET /api/jarvis/memory/{id}` — identical content + provenance.
4. Or: `python -m pytest tests/test_acceptance.py::TestContinuityAcceptance -q`

## API

- `GET /health` — `schema: continuity-ledger-v1`
- `GET /api/jarvis/memory/retrieve` — memories + `selections` + `conflicts` (surfaces disputes; does not pick truth)
- `GET /api/jarvis/memory/conflicts?subject=`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/jarvis/memory[/{id}]`
- Board: `GET/POST/PATCH /api/jarvis/memory/board`
- `POST /api/jarvis/memory/pipeline` — EMR → STM → LTM governed consolidation (draft-only)
